Game of Thrones Trivia is an open source Android quiz game (just for fun). In anticipation of the final season, I have created a quiz app for people to play and just have fun.

## Features
**Multiple levels** - The `Easy` level is unlocked by default and users have to get a certain amount of points to unlock the `Medium` or `Hard` level.

**Countdown timer** - Each level has a countdown. 10 seconds to the end of the countdown, a warning is shown to the user. Once the time as elapsed, the game ends immediately

**Share** - Share your scores on multiple platforms
